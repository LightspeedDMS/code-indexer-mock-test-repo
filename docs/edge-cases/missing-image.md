# Document with Missing Image

This document references an image that does not exist.

## The Missing Diagram

Below should be a network diagram, but the file is missing:

![Network Diagram](../../images/network-diagram-missing.png)

The indexer should skip this image and log a warning, but continue indexing the text content.

## Additional Content

This paragraph contains searchable text that should still be indexed even though the image above is missing.

Keywords for testing: network topology, firewall rules, load balancer configuration.
